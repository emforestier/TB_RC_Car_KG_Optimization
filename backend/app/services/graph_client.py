"""
Neo4j driver wrapper: connect and run parameterized Cypher.

The _GraphClient class uses a singleton driver pattern — one connection
pool is shared across the whole app regardless of how many requests come in.

What is already done for you:
  - The driver initialization (singleton pattern in __init__).
  - verify_connectivity() for health checks.
  - close_graph_driver() for shutdown cleanup.

What you need to implement:
  - run_query() — execute a Cypher string against Neo4j and return the rows.
