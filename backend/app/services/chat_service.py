"""
Chat orchestration: Gemini generates read-only Cypher → Neo4j → formatted answer.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY (or GOOGLE_API_KEY) from Google AI Studio.

What is already done for you:
  - Imports, config loading, Cypher extraction/validation helpers.
  - The run_chat() function that ties everything together.

What you need to implement:
  - The system instruction (prompt) that tells Gemini how to behave.
  - The actual Gemini API call that sends the user's question and gets Cypher back.

    # This string is the "system prompt" — it tells Gemini what role it plays
    # and what rules to follow. Your instruction should include:
    #
    #   1. Tell Gemini it is a Neo4j Cypher assistant.
    #   2. Tell it to output ONLY a single Cypher query (nothing else).
    #   3. List the READ-ONLY Cypher clauses it may use:
    #      MATCH, OPTIONAL MATCH, RETURN, WHERE, WITH, ORDER BY, LIMIT, SKIP,
    #      UNWIND, COUNT, collect, DISTINCT, CASE.
    #   4. Explicitly forbid write clauses:
    #      CREATE, MERGE, DELETE, SET, REMOVE, DROP, FOREACH.
    #   5. Include the graph schema from settings so Gemini knows the node labels
    #      and relationship types. Access it via: settings.graph_schema
    #
    # Assign the result to a variable called `system_instruction`.
    #

    #   4. Pass the text through extract_cypher() to strip markdown fences.
    #   5. Return the clean Cypher string.
