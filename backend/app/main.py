"""
FastAPI application entrypoint.

This file creates the app object that uvicorn runs. It is responsible for:
  1. Cleaning up the Neo4j connection when the app shuts down (lifespan).
  2. Allowing the React frontend to talk to this API (CORS middleware).
  3. Registering the route files so /health and /chat actually exist.

What is already done for you:
  - The FastAPI app with its lifespan (handles Neo4j shutdown).
  - All necessary imports.

What you need to implement:
  - CORS middleware so the frontend (port 5173) can call the backend (port 8000).
  - Router registration so the API endpoints are available.

# TODO-4 (Required): Add CORS middleware.
#

# The React frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 but the API runs on
# http://localhost:8000. Browsers block cross-origin requests by default.
# CORS middleware tells the browser "it's okay, let the frontend talk to me."
#
# Call:
#   app.add_middleware(
#       CORSMiddleware,
#       allow_origins=["*"],        # which domains can call us ("*" = any)
#       allow_credentials=True,     # allow cookies/auth headers
#       allow_methods=["*"],        # allow GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
#       allow_headers=["*"],        # allow any request headers
#   )
#
# In production you'd replace "*" with your actual frontend URL, but for
# local development "*" is fine.


# TODO-5 (Required): Register the route files (routers).
#
# FastAPI uses "routers" to organize endpoints into separate files.
# The health and chat modules each export a `router` object.
# You need to include both so the /health and /chat URLs work.
#
# Call app.include_router() once for each router:
#   app.include_router(health.router)
#   app.include_router(chat.router)
#
# After this, visiting http://localhost:8000/health and POSTing to
# http://localhost:8000/chat will hit the functions in those files.
